# Deploy scripts

A collection of works-out-of-the-box deploy scripts for various frameworks to cloud providers.

These are designed to be run from the command line, but can also be adapted into scripts for any CI/CD engine as well. A few examples are provided - since CI scripts are mostly the same across CI/CD engines, these can work with minimum modification.
